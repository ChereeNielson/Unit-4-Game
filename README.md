# Drink Collector! #

Drink as many shots as you can without going over the "party" limit. Are you a light weight? :tropical_drink::cocktail:

## What this project does ## 

This project is mainly contained in simple `object`, containing all game `variables` and `methods`. Random numbers are generated with `for loops` and `if-else statements` and user input is collected with `on-click functions`.

## How users can get started with this project ## 

### How to Play: ###

1. **[Start the game](https://chereenielson.github.io/Unit-4-Game/)**.
    - Under the title, some friendly drinking game instructions will appear. The target shots, current shots taken, user scores, and available drinks will display beneath the instructions.

2. **Select different drinks to increase your current shots taken to match the target shots value**.
    - Each drink is worth a different value and clicking each drink will increase your current shots taken by its value.

3. **Win or lose**.
    - If you successfully increase your shots taken exactly to the target shots value, you'll earn a win! An alert will congratulate you with instructions to "Party On!"
    - If your shots taken exceeds the target shots value, you'll incur a loss. An alert will inform you that "You've had a few too many!"

4. **Play again**!
    - After either a win or a loss, your current shots will clear and each drink will be assigned a new value, allowing you to keep playing as long as you'd like.
